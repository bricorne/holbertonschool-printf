<h1>Welcome to the README of this project!</h1>

<i>This project consists in recreating the printf function in C language.</i>

<h3>Features:</h3>

The printf function prints text to standard output, including variables. In this project, we have recreated a version of the printf function that only takes into account the following conversion specifiers:
<ul>
  <li>%d and %i: displays an integer (positive or negative)</li>

  <li>%c: displays a character</li>

  <li>%s: displays a character string</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use :</h3>

To use the _printf function, just include the main.h file and call it in your program. The main.h file calls all the functions necessary for the proper functioning of the program.

<h3>Flowchart :</h3>
