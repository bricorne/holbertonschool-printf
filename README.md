Welcome to the README of this project!

This project consists in recreating the printf function in C language.

Features:

The printf function prints text to standard output, including variables. In this project, we have recreated a version of the printf function that only takes into account the following conversion specifiers:

%d and %i: displays an integer (positive or negative)

%c: displays a character

%s: displays a character string

Use :

To use the _printf function, just include the main.h file and call it in your program. The main.h file calls all the functions necessary for the proper functioning of the program.
